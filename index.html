                  Brett O'Connell is a 3L at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law. Brett has developed a passion for progressive advocacy early in his burgeoning legal career, externing under the Honorable Judge Jerry Esrig in the Law Division of the Cook County Circuit Court.
                  <br><br>
                  Brett has demonstrated an early interest in the field of data privacy 
                  law. With the advent of the GDPR and the impending impact of massive data 
                  breaches in the United States and abroad, Brett believes 
                  that more attorneys and developers alike will be required to
                  serve the interests of data subjects and protect the rights 
                  of consumers.

                    Brett graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in history and gender studies. During law school, he was selected to serve as the 2018-19 student articles editor for the Loyola's well-respected International Law Review. His first major academic work, a note on the ongoing implications of America's dated refugee intake policy in the new age of climate migrancy, is to be published in the International Law Review this coming fall. 

                    <br><br>

                    Brett believes that the fields of law and technology are inexorably connected, and that attorneys will increasingly be required to navigate the intricacies of both subjects in the years to come. To that end, he has chosen to pursue a technical education in web design and full stack development in tandem with his law degree. The projects exhibited here are examples of his technical portfolio.
